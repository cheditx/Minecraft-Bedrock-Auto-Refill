# Minecraft-Bedrock-Auto-Refill
A simple C# code that allows you to take all the potions available in your inventory and put them in the hotbar quickly.
This code was written simply out of boredom, I personally don't use it and I won't use it, it was just out of boredom xd, so don't take the code seriously, I was just bored.
